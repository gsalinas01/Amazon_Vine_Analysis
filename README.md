# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview
In this project, I conducted a meta-analysis on reviews from the Amazon Vine Program. This challenge allowed me to learn about AWS's RDBs and S3 buckets and helped me understand the ETL process in a hands-on manner. 
The main goal of this analysis was to determine the level of bias, if any, between paid amazon reviews and unpaid amazon reviews in the Vine Program.

The analysis was drawn from a dataset of videogame reviews: https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Video_Games_v1_00.tsv.gz

Technologies used: PySpark, Google Colab
